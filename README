This program is GPL-licensed postcardware! More infos at end of README.
                             """""""""""""
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY! Use on your own risk.

purpose:
--------
  load 'vcgt'-tag of ICC profiles to X-server like MS-Windows or MacOS 
  do it to calibrate your display.
  Versions 0.5 and higher are also usable with Microsoft Windows. They
  can be used as a free alternative to other calibration loaders.

usage:
------
  xcalib [-options] ICCPROFILE

  where the available options are:
    -display <host:dpy>     or -d
    -screen <screen-#>      or -s
    -clear                  or -c
    -noaction               or -n
    -verbose                or -v
    -printramps             or -p
    -loss                   or -l
    -help                   or -h
    -version

  last parameter MUST be an ICC profile containing a vcgt or mLUT tag.

  use profiles gamma_1_0.icc and gamma_2_2.icc for testing. Profiles
  with vcg-tables can be created with most profile creation suites.
  An example profile with a vcg-table is inclued, named bluish.icc,
  which simulates a very high whitepoint (without further intentions).

requirements:
-------------
  This program is intended for X11-Servers like XFree86 that come with
  XVidModeExtension (e.g. XFree86 4.x.x). Make sure that the extension
  is available. Other X-servers like OpenWin do not contain XVidMode
  stuff - so please don't ask me for support if XVidMode isn't
  supported.

  Since version 0.5, Win32-support was added. The program will work
  with most video cards, that have correctly implemented drivers.

  As of version 0.6, a special treatment for the close-source ATI FGLRX
  X11 driver was added. XVidMode is still required.
  
  You need a profile which contains the 'vcgt' tag to achieve
  monitor calibration. You can create it with some commercial
  windows profile creation programs or use the bundled ones from Bruce
  Lindbloom (only Gamma 1.0 and 2.2).

install:
--------
  The bundled Makefile should work on most systems. It is very simple
  and doesn't use automake/autoconf stuff. Therefore you and I (the
  author) save time writing fancy autoconf/automake tests. One of the
  following commands should lead you to a working version of xcalib:

  $ make icclib_xcalib
  $ make lcms_xcalib
  $ make lo_xcalib

  $ make win_xcalib
  $ make fglrx_xcalib

  The make targets correspond to the possible ICC reader
  implementations:
  - Graeme Gill's "icclib"
    I decided to include it in the xcalib distribution for
    convenience reasons. It is known to work and is stable!
  - Marti Maria's "lcms"
    You must build it from patched sources. A patch for version 1.13
    is included (which works for 1.14 as well).
    Patching is done by cd'ing to the lcms source directory and
    applying patch:   $  patch -p1 -i DIR_OF_PATCH/lcms1.13_patch
    If you have a version of lcms on your system that came with your
    distribution, then don't forget to make the patched library
    active (e.g. by deinstalling the unpatched one or setting 
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH ...)
    I decided to use internal lcms gamma calculation and smoothing to
    allow extrapolation for big video LUTs. This leads to slightly
    different values compared to the other exact methods. The error
    is not dramatic, but check this on your own if you really want to
    use it and fear the introduced error.
  - the included but limited one can read vcgt tags only and is meant
    for low overhead or standalone versions of xcalib. It was tested
    on little-endian systems only. Please contact me if you encounter
    any problems.

  The Win32 version was made with and tested for MinGW. Since most
  users do not have a running MinGW environment, a binary executable is
  provided. To compile it on your own, the following command creates a
  working Win32-build (tested with MSys):

  $ make win_xcalib

  Win32 was only tested with the internal parser - lcms and icclib
  support are not planned.

  For ATI's proprietary FGLRX driver for X11, a special version can be
  built. Issue the command

  $ make fglrx_xcalib

  on the commandline. For now, only the internal parser can be used
  in combination with this server backend.
 
motivation:
-----------
  ICC profiles created and used with MS-Windows can now also be used
  with Linux and other unixes with LCMS, Marti's ICC library. Some
  applications can already apply profiles (even display profiles) but
  they often use standard monitor profiles or custom profiles created
  for a calibrated monitor.

  Calibration is the motivation for xcalib. Calibration brings your
  monitor to a defined state. Color spaces of profiles are often only
  valid for this defined state, which was created by a calibration.

  Whenever you use a display profile, created with Gretag's
  ProfileMaker, AdobeGamma (not that good but better than nothing) or
  most other ICC profile creation packages, 'vcgt'-tags are included.
  These profiles are only valid with calibration applied!

  You get the point?

  Once again, a profile contains mainly the characterization of a
  device. This characterization should be constant over time for as
  long as possible. Therefore, you need a defined state, you can return
  to - this is the calibrated state.

  Calibration linearizes your device, helps to set characteristics and
  can be easily repeated. Repeating calibration can help you to keep
  your profile constant (users don't need to change it).
  
  The current way of embedding calibration data in a profile is against
  the theory of separating calibration from profiling - but we have to 
  live with it since it's common. They use a tag called Video Card
  Gamma Tag (or vcgt) in ICC-profiles that contains calibration values.
  The calibration is applied before profile creation, where the vcgt
  
  will be saved in your profile for convenience reasons: All color
  settings for the display device are stored in a common file.

  So, let's repeat: We have calibration and profile creation - which
  are not the same. But calibration helps the user in the profile
  creation by having a linear (or linear with respect to a fixed gamma
  value) display device.

  Linux was missing a tool like 'AdobeGammaLoader' or 'Logo Calibration
  Loader' which applied the vcgt-tag to the video-LUT (a matrix which
  assigns one color value to another). Under Linux we can not set the
  video-LUT itself but a X-server gamma ramp (which does practically
  the same).

  Applying gamma ramps in the video-LUT has one big advantage: If used
  with proper values, all applications benefit from a monitor in a
  defined/calibrated state - although not using color management!

  But keep the drawback in mind: You will loose some resolution by
  using a tool like AdobeGamme oder xcalib. This may leed to
  posterization artifacts on your display (but doesn't affect
  printouts). You should tweak your monitor for perfect linearization
  as much as possible - the remaining tweaks might be part of a
  profile (, the "vcgt" tag). 
  
  If you want to come around that drawback: bug your video card vendor
  and ask for >8bit LUTs (plus LUTs for every output connector).

limitations:
------------
  Not all XFree video card drivers do allow changing the gamma ramps.
  And video cards are often having only one LUT for all outputs -
  although they are dual-head models.

  Known not-working drivers:
  - vesa (generic driver without any calibration knobs)
  - fglrx (but you can build fglrx_xcalib)

  If you see both/only one/no display changing it's behaviour, test if
  it's a bug of xcalib by cross-checking with the 'xgamma' tool that
  comes with every XFree86 distribution.

  Custom curves created with AdobeGamma do not contain these in the
  vcgt. The vcgt contains 2.2 in all cases, whereas the real LUT-values
  that are downloaded to the X-server are located somewhere else in the
  system - but nobody know's where. Please tell me where they are - if
  you find them. A newer version of AdobeGamma (from 2003) writes a
  vcgt tag with useful data. Nevertheless, the size field is wrong. As
  of version 0.6, basic concealment for wrong AdobeGamma profiles
  (created with the 2003 version) was added to the internal parser.

  On Win32-systems, some drivers are not correctly implemented. E.g.
  the NVidia Riva driver for Windows2000 and WindowsXP wrote nonsense
  values to the video cards RAMDAC (resulting in a gray display). I
  used for these cards an old NT-driver from a video card vendor.
  
  The source code became messy in the last time because of numerous
  workarounds and a bad mixture of Win32, X11, ATI code and code for
  the different parsers used to get the gamma ramps from the profile.
  This makes it hard to find the important code sections for others
  than me and might have lead to bugs or leaks. A following version
  will most likely be ported to C++ to ease modularisation of the code
  and allow utilization by other software.
  
history:
--------
  0.6:
    - added 0-interpolated upscaling if LUT>vcgt
    - added reading of mLUT instead of vcgt (not memory-safe for now)
      this is used for profiles, created by ProfileMechanic Monitor
    - added concealment for obviously wrong profiles made by AdobeGamma
    - added fglrx version for ATI's proprietary driver
    - added loss calculation (option "-loss" or "-l") which shows how
      many steps are lost by calibrating the device
    - added limits of VideoCardGammaFormula to internal parser
    
  0.5: 2005-03-03
    - Win32 version added (compilable with MinGW)
      + support for command line options as usual
      + support for loading the default display profile
    - fixed bug with 8bit vcg-tables in internal and icclib version
      this applied to Pantone ColorVision Spyder profiles only
      thanks to John Ackerman who found this really grave bug
    - fixed bug in lcms patch regarding gamma table endpoints
      use a unpatched version of lcms for patching
    - introduced macro for little-endian parsing in internal parser
    - got rid of some compiler warnings because of multi-byte
      constants
    - introduced variables in Makefile so that the user can set
      locations for X11 and patched lcms libs and headers
    - beautified code for better readability
    - added sample profile which contains a vcg-table
      
  0.4: 2005-01-30
    - own implementation for parsing the vcgt tags added.
    - switch to lcms-1.13 (patched) instead of icclib
      use different make target to activate it
    - LUTs and vcgt-content may now have different size.
      LCMS does scaling for xcalib
      this only works with a LCMS build for now
    - much icc- and vcgt-stuff was exported to LCMS, to give every user
      the ability to use it and to make xcalib's code less confuscating
      apply the bundled patch to LCMS
    - minor README changes to ease readability
    
  0.3:
    - raise error if no vcg-tag available
    - profile no more a necessary parameter after -c and -h option
    - some code cleanup

  0.2: public pre-release
    - added option to reset gamma table to system default (gamma 1.0)
    - screen and display can be selected now
    - as system gamma for Linux, 1/0.45 = 2.222 is assumed
    - bugfixes

  0.1:
    - initial version with vcg-table and vcg-formula working

todo:
-----
  [ ] integrate the _ICC_PROFILE atom
  [ ] interpolated upscaling
  [X] use ATI's API when using the closed-source X11 ATI driver
  [ ] gamma limits of vcgt-spec for icclib and LCMS version
  [ ] further code review for memory leaks
  [x] use platform independent types for better portability
  [X] use lcms instead of icclib: worse vcgt-parsing but functions
      for gamma ramp building and smoothing
  [ ] add multi-monitor support to Win32 version
