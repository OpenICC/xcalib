This program is GPL-licensed postcardware! More infos at end of README.
                             """""""""""""

purpose:
--------
  load 'vcgt'-tag of ICC profiles to X-server like MS-Windows or MacOS 
  do it.

usage:
------
  xcalib [-options] ICCPROFILE

  where the available options are:
    -display host:dpy       or -d
    -screen                 or -s
    -clear                  or -c
    -verbose                or -v

  last parameter MUST be an ICC profile containing vcgt-tag

  use profiles gamma_1_0.icc and gamma_2_2.icc for testing. Profiles
  with vcgt-tables can be created with some profile creation suites.

requirements:
-------------
  This program is intended for X11-Servers like XFree86 that come with
  XVidModeExtension (e.g. XFree86 4.x.x). Make sure that the extension
  is available. Other X-servers like OpenWin do not contain XVidMode
  stuff - so please don't ask me for support if XVidMode isn't
  supported.
  
  You need a profile which contains the 'vcgt' tag to achieve
  monitor calibration. You can create it with some commercial
  windows profile creation programs or use the bundled ones from Bruce
  Lindbloom (only Gamma 1.0 and 2.2).

motivation:
-----------
  ICC profiles created and used with MS-Windows can now also be used
  with Linux and other unixes with LCMS, Marti's ICC library. Some
  applications can already apply profiles (even display profiles) but
  they often use standard monitor profiles or custom profiles created
  for a calibrated monitor.

  Calibration is the motivation for xcalib. Calibration brings your
  monitor to a defined state. Color spaces of profiles are often only
  valid for this defined state, which was created by a calibration.

  Whenever you use a display profile, created with Gretag's
  ProfileMaker, AdobeGamma (not that good but better than nothing) or
  most other ICC profile creation packages, 'vcgt'-tags are included.
  These profiles are only valid with calibration applied!

  You get the point?

  Once again, a profile contains mainly the characterization of a
  device. This characterization should be constant over time for as
  long as possible. Therefore, you need a defined state, you can return
  to - this is the calibrated state.

  Calibration linearizes your device, helps to set characteristics and
  can be easily repeated. Repeating calibration can help you to keep
  your profile constant (users don't need to change it).
  
  The current way of embedding calibration data in a profile is against
  the theory of separating calibration from profiling - but we have to 
  live with it since it's common. They use a tag called Video Card
  Gamma Tag (or vcgt) in ICC-profiles that contains calibration values.
  The calibration is applied before profile creation, the vcgt saved in
  your profile.

  So, let's repeat: We have calibration and profile creation - which
  are not the same. But calibration helps the user in the profile
  creation by having a linear (or linear with respect to a fixed gamma
  value) display device.

  Linux was missing a tool like 'AdobeGamma' or 'Logo Calibration
  Loader' which applied the vcgt-tag to the video-LUT (a matrix which
  assigns one color value to another). Under Linux we can not set the
  video-LUT itself but a X-server gamma ramp (which does practically
  the same).

  Applying gamma ramps in the video-LUT has one big advantage: If used
  with proper values, all applications benefit from a monitor in a
  defined/calibrated state - although not using color management!

  But keep the drawback in mind: You will loose some resolution by
  using a tool like AdobeGamme oder xcalib. This may leed to
  posterization artifacts on your display (but doesn't affect
  printouts). You should tweak your monitor for perfect linearization
  as much as possible - the remaining tweaks might be done by xcalib.

  If you want to come around that drawback: bug your video card vendor
  and ask for >8bit LUTs (plus LUTs for every output connector).

limitations:
------------
  Not all XFree video card drivers do allow changing the gamma ramps.
  And video cards are often having only one LUT for all outputs -
  although they are dual-head models.

  If you see both/only one/no display changing it's behaviour, test if
  it's a bug of xcalib by cross-checking with the 'xgamma' tool that
  comes with every XFree86 distribution.
  
history:
--------
  0.3:
    - raise error if no vcg-tag available
    - profile no more a necessary parameter after -c and -h option
    - some code cleanup

  0.2: public pre-release
    - added option to reset gamma table to system default (gamma 1.0)
    - screen and display can be selected now
    - as system gamma for Linux, 1/0.45 = 2.222 is assumed
    - bugfixes

  0.1:
    - initial version with vcg-table and vcg-formula working

todo:
-----
  - gamma limits of vcgt-spec need to be implemented
  - further code review for memory leaks
  - use platform independent types for better portability
  - use lcms instead of icclib: worse vcgt-parsing but functions
    for gamma ramp building and smoothing

bugs:
-----
  if not already mentioned in this README, contact the author if you
  find bugs in this software.

    constant color quality for their large-format-printers and led me
    to color-management using ICC profiles

    used!?)
